# CNN-Based-Plant-Disease-Prediction-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
🚀This project aims to develop a CNN based AI system that predict plant disease from leaf images.

• The objective is to train a CNN model on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images representing various diseases and healthy cases, ensuring robust disease recognition even under varying environmental conditions.       This predictive system will contribute to sustainability by minimizing crop losses, reducing environmental degradation, and supporting green agriculture through precision farming facilitated by AI technologies.
