# CNN-Based-Plant-Disease-Prediction-for-Sustainable-Agriculture
🚀This project aims to develop a CNN based AI system that predict plant disease from leaf images.

# 🎯Objective
• The objective is to train a CNN model on a diverse dataset of plant leaf images representing various diseases and healthy cases, ensuring robust disease recognition even under varying environmental conditions.       This predictive system will contribute to sustainability by minimizing crop losses, reducing environmental degradation, and supporting green agriculture through precision farming facilitated by AI technologies.

# 📊Dataset
This project uses the 🔗https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset dataset available on kaggle.
This dataset consists of about 87K rgb images of healthy and diseased crop leaves which is categorized into 38 different classes. The total dataset is divided into 80/20 ratio of training and validation set preserving the directory structure. A new directory containing 33 test images is created later for prediction purpose.
